## [Practice 0](./Practice%200/) - Fibonacci Sequence

Is the sequence of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones

## [Practice 1](./Practice%201/) - Sorting Algorithms Part I

**Bubble Sort** and **Merge Sort** are two of the most famous sorting algorithms. In this practice, you will implement them and compare their performance.

## [Practice 2](./Practice%202/) - Sorting Algorithms Part II

**Quick Sort** and **Heap Sort** are two of the most popular sorting algorithms. They are both divide and conquer algorithms. They are both comparison based sorting algorithms. They are both in-place algorithms. They are both non-comparison based sorting algorithms.

## [Practice 3](./Practice%203/) - Sorting Algorithms Part III

**Radix Sort** and **Counting Sort** are two sorting algorithms that are not based on comparison. They are used to sort a list of numbers in linear time. Radix sort is used to sort numbers with a large range, and Counting sort is used to sort numbers with a small range.

## [Practice 4](./Practice%204/) - Searching Algorithms Part I

**Linear Search** and **Binary Search** are the two most common searching algorithms. Linear search is a very simple search algorithm. In this type of search, a sequential search is made over all items one by one. Every item is checked and if a match is found then that particular item is returned, otherwise the search continues till the end of the data collection.

## [Practice 5](./Practice%205/) - Searching Algorithms Part II

Hash Table is a data structure that maps keys to values for highly efficient lookup. In a hash table, the keys are generated by a hash function that determines the location of each key in the table. The hash function is used to map the key to a location in the hash table where its corresponding value can be stored or retrieved.

## [Practice 6](./Practice%206/) - Graphs I

A graph is a data structure that consists of a finite (and possibly mutable) set of vertices or nodes

## [Practice 7](./Practice%207/) - Graphs II

The graph class has a dictionary of nodes. The key is the name of the station and the value is the node.

## [Practice 8](./Practice%208/) - Trees I

A full Binary tree is a special type of binary tree in which every parent node/internal node has either two or no children.

## [Practice 9](./Practice%209/) - Trees II



## [Practice 10](./Practice%2010/) - Files



## [Practice 11](./Practice%2011/) - Threads OpenMP



## [Practice 12](./Practice%2012/) - Parallel Programming I



## [Practice 13](./Practice%2013/) - Parallel Programming II
