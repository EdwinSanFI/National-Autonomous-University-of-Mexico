## Sorting Algorithms Part 1

### Bubble Sort 

Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted. The algorithm gets its name from the way smaller elements "bubble" to the top of the list. Because it only uses comparisons to operate on elements, it is a comparison sort. Although the algorithm is simple, it is too slow and impractical for most problems even when compared to insertion sort. It can be practical if the input is usually in sort order but may occasionally have some out-of-order elements nearly in position.

python code:

```python
def bubble_sort(arr):
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        for j in range(len(arr)-1):
            if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:
                arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]
    return arr
```

### Buble Sort Optimized

```python
def bubble_sort_optimized(arr):
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        swapped = False
        for j in range(len(arr)-1):
            if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:
                arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]
                swapped = True
        if not swapped:
            break
    return arr
```

### Merge Sort

Merge sort is a divide and conquer algorithm based on the idea of breaking down a list into several sub-lists until each sublist consists of a single element and merging those sublists in a manner that results into a sorted list.

python code:

```python
def merge_sort(arr):
    if len(arr) > 1:
        mid = len(arr) // 2
        left = arr[:mid]
        right = arr[mid:]
        merge_sort(left)
        merge_sort(right)
        i = j = k = 0
        while i < len(left) and j < len(right):
            if left[i] < right[j]:
                arr[k] = left[i]
                i += 1
            else:
                arr[k] = right[j]
                j += 1
            k += 1
        while i < len(left):
            arr[k] = left[i]
            i += 1
            k += 1
        while j < len(right):
            arr[k] = right[j]
            j += 1
            k += 1
    return arr
```
