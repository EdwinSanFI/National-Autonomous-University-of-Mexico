## Sorting Algorithms Part II - Quick Sort and Heap Sort

### Quick Sort
#### Invenred by Tony Hoare in 1959
#### Quick Sort is a divide and conquer algorithm.
#### It picks the last element as a pivot and partitions the given array around the picked pivot.
#### If an element (pivot) is selected and all the elements are placed
#### minor elements to this left side and all elements greater than this on the right side, the selected item will remain
#### arranged in position.
# Time Complexity: O(n log n)

### Heap Sort
#### Heap Sort is a comparison based sorting algorithm.
#### It is an in-place algorithm.
#### It is a non-comparison based sorting algorithm.

#### Time Complexity: O(n log n)
